# PalmTree
## Status: Beta
A lightweight service starter, and monitor to ensure programs keep running.

## Usage
Palm tree is super easy to use. It was designed for NodeOS so it needs to be embeded in the startup process. On a NodeOS system, you can swap out your "Hi, I'm a user init script" script with PalmTree's init.js. On any other OS, you can have your os's program starter execute PalmTree.
